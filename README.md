## Supplemental Materials
Supplemental materials, organized per chapter, can be found in this [subfolder](https://github.com/MarcoDVisser/thesis/tree/master/SupplementalMaterial).

## Simulation code
An adaptation of the simple patch model by Pacala 1997 in R, with parts refactored in C++ using Rcpp, is given in this [subfolder](https://github.com/MarcoDVisser/thesis/tree/master/R). This (simple) model explores the effects of negative density dependent dispersal as documented by Jansen et al. 2014 on species richness.
